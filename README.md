 The Police agencies around the world are anxious and eager to reduce crime . An increasing incidence of crime has led to the development and use of computer-aided diagnosis system, tools and methods in analyzing, classifying and predicting crimes.
 
 Data Mining, as the method of analyzing different type of data to extract interesting patterns and knowledge, is also used to discover critical information which can help local authorities detect crime as well as predicting areas which have high probability for occurrence of crime and indicate crime prone areas including the type of crimes.
 
 We can apply data mining techniques to forcast time  series for different crime rates so that it can be very  beneficial for the police as well as for the government  as they will know which are the more crime prone  areas and which area has which crime rate more.
